**Power BI Dashboard & Presentation Project**

Welcome to my Power BI project repository! ðŸŽ‰ This project showcases my skills in transforming raw data into insightful, interactive dashboards using Power BI. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the power of data visualization and how actionable insights can be drawn from complex datasets.

In addition to the Power BI dashboards, I've also included a PowerPoint presentation that explains the methodology behind the visualizations, design choices, and the story behind the data. It's a comprehensive guide to understanding how the visualizations were built and how they can drive data-driven decision-making.

**Key Features:**
- Interactive Power BI dashboards with filters and dynamic visuals.
- Clean, organized, and intuitive design for better data exploration.
- PowerPoint presentation detailing the project objectives, process, and results.

Feel free to explore the repository, provide feedback, and contribute to the project! ðŸš€
